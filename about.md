# Who am I?

I am Xitong Gao.  I recently graduated *PhD* from Imperial College London
in 2016.  I was fortunate to study under the supervision of [Prof George
Constantinides][george] in [Circuits and System Research Group][cas].  I also
studied *MEng Information Systems Engineering* in Imperial College London
from 2008 to 2012 and graduated with first-class honours, and the prestige to
receive both the Governors' prize for the most outstanding student and the
award for the best final year project.

I also maintain a somewhat-active [LinkedIn][linkedin] account.


# Research Interests

During my PhD studies I specialize in analyzing and optimizing program
performance synthesized into FPGA circuits using algorithmic equivalences to
trade-off accuracy, area and latency.

My current focus is on efficient hardware design of deep neural networks.
